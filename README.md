# Gears-Vk-Starter
A template for [Gears-Vk](https://github.com/cg-tuwien/Gears-Vk) projects.

## Handling Assets
There are two special directories in this project: `/shaders` and `/assets`
These two directories will be copied to the same location as the executable after it has been built, so in your source
code you can just use relative paths when loading shaders, models or textures.
